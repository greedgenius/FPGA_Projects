This is a hobby project I worked on several weekends, it is intended to build some interesting FPGA project that communicates with PC and does something.
The project was been abandoned for quite a while, but there is still some modules that I can use for future projects.
It is also an example of how to build a simple open source simulation and synthesis environment with Linux.

This project contains the following IP I've built
	A non-buffered UART module with TX/RX capability, and simple testcase for UART
	Depp module connected to memory, tested with Basys2 FPGA.
	A SPI module with simple testcase to verify
The Makefile in projects/usb_app is also useful for simulation and synthesis 

The project was tested on Ubuntu with the following progarms installed
Simulation
	- icarus
	- gtkwave
FPGA
	- Xilinx ISE
	- digilent Basys2 board 
	- digilent adept
	- libusb

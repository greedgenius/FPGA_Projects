this is a project where you can build, simulate some simple modules.
To get this stuff running you will need:
for simulation
	- icarus
	- gtkwave
for synthesis
	- Xilinx ISE
for FPGA
	- you'll need a digilent Basys2 board (or you can modify the environment for other boards)
	- digilent adept
	- libusb
	
That's about all I can remember for now, good luck!

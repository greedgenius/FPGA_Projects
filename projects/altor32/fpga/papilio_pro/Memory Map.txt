
Memory Map
----------

The XC6LX9 has 64KB of BlockRAM which has been instantiated as 'BootRAM'.
This memory is pre-initialised with a bootloader image which can be used to load new code via the serial port using X-Modem file transfer protocol.

Map:
0x10000000 - 0x10002000		= Bootloader (8KB)
0x10002000 - 0x10010000		= Application space (56KB)


The bootloader section 0x10000000 - 0x10002000 (8KBytes) can be re-used for BSS & Data sections for the application (thus overwriting the bootloader post boot).
